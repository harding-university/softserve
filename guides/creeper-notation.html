<h1 id="creeper-notation">Creeper Notation</h1>
<p>This document describes the state and action notation used by
Softserve for the game <a
href="https://www.grahams-games.co.uk/creeper.html">Creeper</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of this notation in use can be found at the <a
href="https://softserve.harding.edu/ui">UI visualizer</a> and the <a
href="https://softserve.harding.edu/docs#/state"><code>/state</code>
API</a> endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="state-notation">State Notation</h2>
<p>The state is encoded as a string of 86 characters, divided into the
following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>49 characters representing the state of the pins</li>
<li>36 characters representing the state of the paths</li>
<li>1 character representing the next player to move</li>
</ul>
<p>The grids are encoded top-to-bottom, left-to-right. <code>x</code>
denotes the first player, <code>o</code> denotes the second player, and
<code>.</code> denotes an empty space. All letters should be
lowercase.</p>
<p>The pin grid does not have corners, but treat them as empty for the
sake of notation.</p>
<p>Thus, the <a href="https://softserve.harding.edu/ui">initial
state</a> is encoded as:</p>
<p><code>.oo.xx.o.....xo.....x.......x.....ox.....o.xx.oo.o....x........................x....ox</code>
</p>
<p>If we break this notation into the above setions and add newlines, we
see it forms two grids and a single character:</p>
<pre><code>.oo.xx.
o.....x
o.....x
.......
x.....o
x.....o
.xx.oo.

o....x
......
......
......
......
x....o

x</code></pre>
<h2 id="action-notation">Action Notation</h2>
<p>Actions are encoded as a string of 4 characters, which form a pair of
coordinates on the pin grid.</p>
<p>Columns are given a letter, and rows are given a number:</p>
<pre><code>  abcdefg
1 .oo.xx.
2 o.....x
3 o.....x
4 .......
5 x.....o
6 x.....o
7 .xx.oo.</code></pre>
<p>All letters should be lowercase.</p>
<p>Actions consist of the starting and ending coordinate of the pin
being moved. For example, moving the <code>x</code> pin on a5 north one
spot would be <code>a5a4</code>.</p>
<p>No additional notation in used for captures.</p>
